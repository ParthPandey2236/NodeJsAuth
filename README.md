Steps to Add the Nodejs Authentication to your Project : 
 a) Clone the Repository
 b) Install redis to your PC if not installed previously
 c) Replace all the env object members with respective secret keys to be generated by each individual.
 d) Replace the Welcome.ejs file in Views with the ejs file user wants to have after authentication.
 e) Similarly change the file to be rendered in welcome in controller as well as  in router.
After all these steps one can easily set up the project.
Thankyou
